                <div class="recommendation-text">
                    <p>This is the simple, "use it where you spend most" card. You get 5x on your highest category each billing cycle—groceries, gas, dining, whatever—on up to <strong>$500</strong>, then it drops to 1x. No category setup and no annual fee, which is the right level of effort.</p>
                    <p>Best for beginners who want easy value without juggling five cards. If you get deeper into travel points later, combine these points with <strong>Citi Strata Premier</strong> to unlock airline and hotel transfers. Bottom line: put one big category here every month, cap at $500, and move the rest elsewhere.</p>

                            <li><strong>Auto 5x on your top category</strong> – Each billing cycle, Citi finds your highest eligible category and pays 5x on the first $500, then 1x; no activation or guessing games. Good for focused spend like groceries or gas in any given month.</li>
                            <li><strong>Travel portal boost</strong> – Earn an extra 4% on hotels, car rentals, and attractions booked through Citi Travel. Handy when rates are close to booking direct; always compare.</li>
                            <li><strong>Foreign transaction fee (heads-up)</strong> – Adds 3% on non-U.S. purchases; bring a different card abroad.</li>

                <h2>Eligible Categories</h2>
                <div class="recommendation-text">
                    <ul class="recommendation-list">
                        <li><strong>Restaurants</strong> – Everyday dining, takeout, and most bars usually count. Limits or catches: Must code as a restaurant; food bought inside hotels, casinos, or stadiums can code as those venues instead. Third-party delivery apps sometimes code differently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Grocery stores</strong> – Weekly food shops and in-store purchases at supermarkets. Limits or catches: Superstores and warehouse clubs often don't code as "grocery." Some delivery services or in-store pharmacies may code differently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gas stations</strong> – Fuel, car washes, and most in-station purchases. Limits or catches: Gas at warehouse clubs or supermarket pumps may not code as "gas station." Paying through certain apps can change the category.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select travel</strong> – Airlines, hotels, car rentals, cruise lines, and many travel agencies. Limits or catches: Must code as travel. Vacation packages, resort fees, or bookings through odd intermediaries can code another way.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select transit</strong> – Subways, buses, commuter rail, ferries, tolls, parking, taxis, and ride shares. Limits or catches: Some municipal apps and third-party processors don't pass the transit category cleanly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select streaming services</strong> – Monthly subscriptions to major video and music platforms. Limits or catches: Only eligible services count; bundles billed through app stores, cable, or third parties may not qualify. Pay the streamer directly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drugstores</strong> – Prescriptions and everyday essentials at stand-alone pharmacies. Limits or catches: Pharmacy counters inside big-box or grocery stores may not code as "drugstore." Clinic visits can code as healthcare.</li>
                        <li><strong>Home improvement stores</strong> – Purchases at hardware and home centers (think tools, paint, fixtures). Limits or catches: Appliance outlets, furniture stores, and contractor services may not code as "home improvement."</li>
                        <li><strong>Fitness clubs</strong> – Gym memberships and monthly dues. Limits or catches: Boutique studios, class packs, and personal training can code as "recreation" or "professional services," not a fitness club.</li>
                        <li><strong>Live entertainment</strong> – Tickets bought from venues or primary sellers for concerts, theater, and sporting events. Limits or catches: Resale sites and marketplaces may code as "online services" instead of entertainment; bar or restaurant charges inside a venue usually don't count.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Heads-up:</strong> Custom Cash pays 5% on your single highest eligible category each monthly billing cycle, up to $500 in purchases; everything else earns 1%. Category recognition depends on the merchant category code (how the store is registered), not what you think you bought.</p>

                <h2>Hybrid: Convert Cash to Points</h2>
                <div class="recommendation-text">
                    <p>Citi Custom Cash is an easy 5% back on your top category (up to <strong>$500</strong> each cycle). If you want extra value, pair it with <strong>Citi Strata Premier</strong> (or <strong>Citi Strata Elite</strong>): move your rewards into that account, then transfer to airline and hotel partners where redemptions can beat the usual <strong>1¢-per-point</strong> math.</p>
                    <p>This is optional and a bit advanced—you'll learn award bookings and stay flexible on dates. Quick upside: think $500 in cash vs. potentially <strong>$750–$1,000+</strong> in flights if you catch a good transfer deal with partners like <strong>United</strong> (via Aeroplan/Avios options), <strong>JetBlue</strong>, or British Airways Avios.</p>
