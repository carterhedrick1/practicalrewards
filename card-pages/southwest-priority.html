                <h2>Practical Recommendation</h2>
                <div class="recommendation-text">
                    <p>If you fly Southwest a few times a year, this is the "live in the ecosystem" card: first checked bag free for everyone on your reservation, earlier boarding (Group 5), and seat selection perks once assigned seating goes live in 2026. You also get 7,500 anniversary points and a yearly shot at better boarding positions.</p>
                    <p>The fee jumped to $229, so make sure you'll actually use the airline credits through 2025 and the new bag/seat perks in 2026. Bottom line: frequent or even semi-regular Southwest flyers can justify the fee; occasional flyers should skip it.</p>
